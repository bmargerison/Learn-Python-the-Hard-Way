1. Write or draw the problem:
Death - when the player dies, selection of death types
Central chamber - the middle room form which player selects the doors
Door - the choices are player makes to enter certain rooms
	door1 - dead instantly
	door2 - 1 in 10 chance of picing correct door
	door3 - where the player obtains the thing required for the final room
	door4 - fake door
	treasure room - the final room where the player wins

2. Extract key concpets and research them



3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts
Map
	- next_scene
	- opening_scene
Engine
	- play
Scene
	- enter
	- death
	- door1
	- door2 
	- door3 
	- door4
	- treasure room

4. Code the classes and a test to run them

5. Repeat and refine
